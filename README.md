## Decription 

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a web developer. The website highlights the web development skills I've learned, particularly in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It provides an overview of my various projects, including both personal and academic work, with an emphasis on practical applications and problem-solving.

## Technologies Used

- 1 HTML5:
Structure of the website, including headers, sections, and other semantic elements.
- 2 CSS:
Styling of the website. You likely used modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for layout, along with media queries for responsive design.
- 3 JavaScript:
To add interactive features, such as dynamic content loading, image handling, or animations on the website.
- 4 React:
For building the front-end of my portfolio website. React helps you create reusable components and manage the state of your app.
- 5 GitHub Pages:
To host your website. GitHub Pages makes it easy to deploy static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
